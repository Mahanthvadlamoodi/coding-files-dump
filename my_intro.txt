I am Venkata Suba Mahanth Vadlamoodi, currently pursuing a Dual Degree in Electrical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur with a specialization in signal processing and a minor in Computer Science. My academic journey is enriched with a micro specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Applications. My CGPA stands at 7.55 on a scale of 10, reflecting my commitment to academic excellence.
Throughout my education, I have nurtured a fervent enthusiasm for problem-solving using C++ programming, which has propelled me into the realms of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and cloud computing. I have actively enhanced my knowledge and skills in these areas through various projects and self-initiatives.
One of my notable projects involved developing a file compression application using Huffman coding, where I employed bit-level operations for efficient data compression and decompression, achieving a 45% reduction in storage utilization. Additionally, I created an image classification model to identify malicious content on social media using deep neural networks. This project allowed me to design and evaluate different CNN architectures, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.53% with the ResNet model.
In addition to my technical projects, I have also developed an expense management application using the MERN stack, enabling users to track and visualize their expenses efficiently. This project honed my skills in full-stack development, particularly in MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js.
Beyond academics, I have excelled in competitive programming, securing a global rank of 75 on CodeChef and achieving a specialist rating on Codeforces. My problem-solving skills have been recognized with a Gold Badge on HackerRank and a top 28 rank on the Interviewbit Institute Leaderboard.
I am passionate about deep learning, particularly in the context of image processing, and I am dedicated to learning and developing deep neural networks to tackle complex challenges in this field. I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate, continuously learn, and contribute to impactful projects in software development and artificial intelligence. I believe my background and experiences make me well-suited for a summer internship at Goldman Sachs, where I can further refine my skills and make meaningful contributions.
